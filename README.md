# Sentimo
-Sentimo is a web-application in which the user can write their daily diary on the basis of experiences and emotions.

-Our application would recognise the emotion of the user who has either typed notes in his diary or has recorded their own speech and entered in the diary. (under progress)

-Further, Sentimo would recommend certain movies of the best fit genre, based on the user's emotions.
